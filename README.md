This is an iOS demo application for calculating a tip, then dividing the total between 1-4 guests.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

Required: User can enter the bill amount
Required: User can select between 18%, 20% and 22% tip, which gets added to the total bill
Optional: Hide everything but the bill amount, then animate it in when the user taps to enter the bill amount
Notes: Spent some time creating the updated UI and animating the touch event. Despite countless google searches and tutorials, I couldn't figure out how to animate the views up 20px, though I would love to learn how.
